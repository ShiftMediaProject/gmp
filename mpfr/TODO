##############################################################################

Documentation:

- add a description of the algorithms used + proof of correctness

- support for accented characters when converting the texi file to
  the dvi file

Installation:

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
  Determine the exp2/exp3 thresholds using tune/tuneup.c.
  A start has been made on this, but there's a noticable step-effect
  in the times making them cross back and forward between which is
  faster.  Hopefully this will go away with improvements to the exp
  code.

Changes in existing functions:

- use (LDBL_MAX/2)+(LDBL_MAX/4*LDBL_EPSILON) instead of loop in tset_ld
	to get largest power of 2 that fits in a long double
	[and avoid overflow exceptions in tests, for example adding
	#if MPFR_HAVE_TESTS_x86
	  x86_fldcw (x86_fstcw () & ~8);
	#endif
	in mpfr_test_init to enable overflow exceptions]
	
- allow the ISO C "P" exponent separator for base 16 in input functions

- merge mpfr_inp_str and mpfr_set_str (cf glibc sscanf/fscanf)
	[mpfr_set_str -> with final '\0',
	 mpfr_strtofr -> without final '\0', returns the number of characters
	 read (or name mpfr_strtod suggested by Kevin, see below)]

Suggestion from Kevin:
- Function: char * mpf_strto (mpz_t ROP, const char *STR)
     Read a floating point number from a string.  If successful the
     result is stored in ROP and the return value points to the
     character after those parsed.  If STR doesn't start with a valid
     number then the return value is `NULL' and the value in ROP is
     undefined.

     Parsing follows the standard C `strtod' function (*note Parsing of
     Integers: (libc)Parsing of Integers.).  This means optional
     leading whitespace, an optional `+' or `-', mantissa digits, and an
     optional exponent consisting of an `e' or `E', an optional sign,
     and digits.  A hex mantissa can be given with a leading `0x' or
     `0X', in which case `p' or `P' introduces the exponent (still in
     decimal).  In addition `inf' or `infinity' with an optional sign,
     or `nan' or `nan(..chars..)', all non case significant, can be
     given.

     There must be at least one digit in the mantissa for the number to
     be valid.  If an exponent has no digits it's ignored and parsing
     stops after the mantissa.  If an `0x' or `0X' is not followed by
     hexadecimal digits, parsing stops after the `0'.

     Note that in the hex format the exponent represents a power of 2,
     ie. the result is MANTISSA*2^EXPONENT.  This is as per the `%a'
     format in `printf' (*note Formatted Output Strings::).

     `mpf_t' does not currently support NaNs or infinities.  The value
     stored to ROP for these is undefined.

     The decimal point character, or string, expected is taken from the
     current locale on systems providing `localeconv'. [end of suggestion]

- in mpfr_set_str, make string comparisons case insensitive and use @Inf@
  and @NaN@ instead of the possibly ambiguous Inf and NaN in bases > 10.
  Modify the other functions to make them consistent with this choice.
  Possibly accept other strings, like those accepted by strtod.

New functions to implement:

- modf (to extract integer and fractional parts), suggested by
	Dmitry Antipov <dmitry.antipov@mail.ru> Thu, 13 Jun 2002
- mpz_set_fr (to set a mpz from a mpfr, with a rounding mode)
	-> cf code in leibniz:mpfr/mpz_set_fr.c
- those from LIA: missing secant, cosecant, cotangent (trigo/hyperbolic)
- atan2
- implement accurate summation algorithms from Demmel
	(http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmel/AccurateSummation.ps)
- mpfr_root to compute x^(1/n) for n integer [suggested by Damien Fisher,
	damien@maths.usyd.edu.au, 20 Jul 2003]

Rounding:

- mpfr_pow isn't completely specified (concerning signed zeros).

Efficiency:

- implement range reduction in sin/cos/tan for large arguments
	(currently too slow for 2^1024)
- mpfr_asin/acos are too slow for small values (2^(-1021) for example)
- idem for mpfr_atanh (2^(-1021) for example)
- improve generic.c to work for number of terms <> 2^k
- rewrite mpfr_greater_p... as native code.
- combine tests for singular values [from Torbjorn Granlund]:
    For example, mpfr_add could have this structure:
    if (MPFR_SINGULAR (a))
      ...
    else if (MPFR_SINGULAR (b)
      ...
    else
      plain operands

- MPFR_CLEAR_NAN is inefficient, MPFR_SET_INF and friends should do a
  single mask and set of their desired flags.

- Nan, inf and the sign might be better off in the _mpfr_exp field,
  since that would mean only one field set by normal operations, and
  set by a simple store since the whole field would be updated.

- mpf_t uses a scheme where the number of limbs actually present can
  be less than the selected precision, thereby allowing low precision
  values (for instance small integers) to be stored and manipulated in
  an mpf_t efficiently.

  Perhaps mpfr should get something similar, especially if looking to
  replace mpf with mpfr, though it'd be a major change.  Alternately
  perhaps those mpfr routines like mpfr_mul where optimizations are
  possible through stripping low zero bits or limbs could check for
  that (this would be less efficient but easier).

Miscellaneous:

- rename mpf2mpfr.h to gmp-mpf2mpfr.h?
  (will wait until mpfr is fully integrated into gmp :-)

- from Kevin Ryde <user42@zip.com.au>:
   Also for pi.c, a pre-calculated compiled-in pi to a few thousand
   digits would be good value I think.  After all, say 10000 bits using
   1250 bytes would still be small compared to the code size!
   Store pi in round to zero mode (to recover other modes).

- problem when reading a float followed by a character, for example 1.5*x
	[from Fabrice.Rouillier@loria.fr, Mon, 04 Dec 2000]

- add tests for nextabove/nextbelow/nexttoward.

- documentation and tests for:
                         =     <     >     unordered
mpfr_greater_p           0     0     1     0
mpfr_greaterequal_p      1     0     1     0
mpfr_less_p              0     1     0     0
mpfr_lessequal_p         1     1     0     0
mpfr_lessgreater_p       0     1     1     0
mpfr_equal_p             1     0     0     0
mpfr_unordered_p         0     0     0     1


Reentrancy / Thread-Safety:

- Temporary changes to emin/emax are not safe (all uses of
  mpfr_save_emin_emax, eg. mpfr_set_q).

- Global variables for caching in mpfr_const_log2 and mpfr_const_pi
  are not safe.


Portability:

- _mpfr_ceil_log2 is IEEE specific.  Many callers only seem to want
  this operation on an integer, which could be done with
  count_leading_zeros from longlong.h.

- mpfr_get_d3 assumes a double is IEEE format.


Possible future MPF / MPFR integration:

- mpf routines can become "extern inline"s calling mpfr equivalents,
  probably just with GMP_RNDZ hard coded, since that's what mpf has
  always done.

- Want to preserve the mpf_t structure size, for binary compatibility.
  Breaking compatibility would cause lots of pain and potential subtle
  breakage for users.  If the fields in mpf_t are not enough then
  extra space under _mp_d can be used.

- mpf_sgn has been a macro directly accessing the _mp_size field, so a
  compatible representation would be required.  At worst that field
  could be maintained for mpf_sgn, but not otherwise used internally.

  mpf_sgn should probably throw an exception if called with NaN, since
  there's no useful value it can return, so it might want to become a
  function.  Inlined copies in existing binaries would hopefully never
  see a NaN, if they only do old-style mpf things.

- mpfr routines replacing mpf routines must be reentrant and thread
  safe, since of course that's what has been documented for mpf.

- mpfr_random will not be wanted since there's no corresponding
  mpf_random and new routines should not use the old style global
  random state.

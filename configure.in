# IMPROVE ME: The default for C++ is disabled.  The tests currently

# to CFLAGS takes only a small step towards this.  It's also probably worth
# worrying whether the C and C++ runtimes from say gcc and a vendor C++ can
# work together.  Some rather broken C++ installations were encountered
# during testing, and though such things clearly aren't GMP's problem, if

# Table of compilers, options, and mpn paths.  This code has various related
# purposes
#
#   - better default CC/CFLAGS selections than autoconf otherwise gives
#   - default CC/CFLAGS selections for extra CPU types specific to GMP
#   - a few tests for known bad compilers
#   - choice of ABIs on suitable systems
#   - selection of corresponding mpn search path
#
# After GMP specific searches and tests, the standard autoconf AC_PROG_CC is
# called.  User selections of CC etc are respected.
#
# Care is taken not to use macros like AC_TRY_COMPILE during the GMP
# pre-testing, since they of course depend on AC_PROG_CC, and also some of
# them cache their results, which is not wanted.
#
# The ABI selection mechanism is unique to GMP.  All that reaches autoconf
# is a different selection of CC/CFLAGS according to the best ABI the system
# supports, and/or what the user selects.  Naturally the mpn assembler code
# selected is very dependent on the ABI.
#
# The closest the standard tools come to a notion of ABI is something like
# "sparc64" which encodes a CPU and an ABI together.  This doesn't seem to
# scale well for GMP, where exact CPU types like "ultrasparc2" are wanted,
# separate from the ABI used on them.
#
#
# The variables set here are
#
#   cclist              the compiler choices
#   xx_cflags           flags for compiler xx
#   xx_cppflags         cpp flags for compiler xx
#   xx_cflags_optlist   list of sets of optional flags
#   xx_cflags_yyy       set yyy of optional flags for compiler xx
#   xx_ldflags          -Wc,-foo flags for libtool linking with compiler xx
#   ar_flags            extra flags for $AR
#   nm_flags            extra flags for $NM
#   limb                limb size, can be "longlong"
#   path                mpn search path
#   extra_functions     extra mpn functions
#
# Suppose xx_cflags_optlist="arch", then flags from $xx_cflags_arch are
# tried, and the first flag that works will be used.  An optlist like "arch
# cpu optimize" can be used to get multiple independent sets of flags tried.
# The first that works from each will be used.  If no flag in a set works
# then nothing from that set is added.
#
# For multiple ABIs, the scheme extends as follows.
#
#   abilist               set of ABI choices
#   cclist_aa             compiler choices in ABI aa
#   xx_aa_cflags          flags for xx in ABI aa
#   xx_aa_cppflags        cpp flags for xx in ABI aa
#   xx_aa_cflags_optlist  list of sets of optional flags in ABI aa
#   xx_aa_cflags_yyy      set yyy of optional flags for compiler xx in ABI aa
#   xx_aa_ldflags         -Wc,-foo flags for libtool linking
#   ar_aa_flags           extra flags for $AR in ABI aa
#   nm_aa_flags           extra flags for $NM in ABI aa
#   limb_aa               limb size in ABI aa, can be "longlong"
#   path_aa               mpn search path in ABI aa
#   extra_functions_aa    extra mpn functions in ABI aa
#
# As a convenience, the unadorned xx_cflags (etc) are used for the last ABI
# in ablist, if an xx_aa_cflags for that ABI isn't given.  For example if
# abilist="64 32" then $cc_64_cflags will be used for the 64-bit ABI, but
# for the 32-bit either $cc_32_cflags or $cc_cflags is used, whichever is
# defined.  This makes it easy to add some 64-bit compilers and flags to an
# unadorned 32-bit set.
#
# limb=longlong (or limb_aa=longlong) applies to all compilers within that
# ABI.  It won't work to have some needing long long and some not, since a
# single instantiated gmp.h will be used by both.
#
# SPEED_CYCLECOUNTER, cyclecounter_size and CALLING_CONVENTIONS_OBJS are
# also set here, with an ABI suffix.
#
#
#
# A table-driven approach like this to mapping cpu type to good compiler
# options is a bit of a maintenance burden, but there's not much uniformity
# between options specifications on different compilers.  Some sort of
# separately updatable tool might be cute.
#
# The use of lots of variables like this, direct and indirect, tends to
# obscure when and how various things are done, but unfortunately it's
# pretty much the only way.  If shell subroutines were portable then actual
# code like "if this .. do that" could be written, but attempting the same
# with full copies of GMP_PROG_CC_WORKS etc expanded at every point would
# hugely bloat the output.

# can provide some functions too.  (mpn/Makefile.am passes
# -DOPERATION_<func> to get them to generate the right code.)

                      M68K MPN SUBROUTINES


This directory contains mpn functions for various m68k family chips.


CODE ORGANIZATION

	m68k             m68000, m68010, m68060
	m68k/mc68020     m68020, m68030, m68040, and CPU32


The m5200 "coldfire", which is m68000 less a few instructions, currently has
no assembler code support.


ASM FILES

The .asm files are put through m4 for macro processing, and with the help of
configure give either MIT or Motorola syntax.  The generic mpn/asm-defs.m4
is used, together with mpn/m68k/m68k-defs.m4.  See comments in those files.

Not all possible syntax variations are covered.  GCC config/m68k for
instance has things like $ for immediates on CRDS or reversed cmp order for
AT&T SGS.  These could probably be handled if anyone really needs it.

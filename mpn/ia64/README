The IA-64 ISA is strange and the Itanium pipeline is bizarre!  How
come everybody else is moving from static to dynamic OOO pipelines,
and Intel moves in the opposite direction?  Compiler writers failed to
generate reasonable code for the static RISC pipelines of the mid
1990'ies, and they sure won't do any better with the IA-64 ISA and its
Itanium implementation!

The IA-64 ISA keeps instructions three and three in 128 bit bundles.
Programmers/compilers need to put explicit breaks `;;' between WAW or
RAW dependencies.  Such breaks can be anywhere in a bundle, or between
bundles.

The Itanium implementation can under ideal conditions execute two
bundles per cycle.  But to reach that rate for integer code, one needs
to sprinkle the code with `nop.f' instructions, one per bundle.  With
good scheduling, one can thus reach a peak execution rate of 4
instructions/cycle.

Taken cloop branches seem to insert a bubble into the pipeline most of
the time.

Loads to the fp registers bypass the L1 cache and thus get extremely
long latencies, 9 cycles.

The software pipeline stuff using br.ctop instruction causes delays,
since many issue slots are taken up by instructions with zero
predicates, and since about 15 extra instructions are needed to set
things up.  These features are designed for code density, not maximum
speed.

Misc pipeline limitations:
* The getf.sig instruction can only execute in M0.
* At most four integer instructions/cycle.
* Nops take up resources like any plain instructions.

================================================================
mpn_add_n, mpn_sub_n:

The current code runs at 3 cycles/limb.  Unrolling could clearly bring
down the time to 2 cycles/limb.

================================================================
mpn_addmul_1:

The current code runs at 3.7 cycles/limb, but that somewhat odd timing
is reached only for huge operands.  It uses the mod-scheduled software
pipelining feature.  The reason for the poor speed for small operands
is that mod-scheduled loops have a very long start-up overhead.

For optimal speed, we need to load two 64-bit limbs with the ldfp8
instruction, and stay away from mod-scheduled loops.  Since rp and up
might be mutually aligned in two ways, we will need two loop variants,
with the same basic structure:

  { .mfi	getf.sig
		xma.l
	   (p6)	cmp.leu		p6, p7 = 
} { .mfi	stf8
		xma.hu
	   (p7)	cmp.ltu		p6, p7 = 
		;;
} { .mib	getf.sig
	   (p6)	add 1
		nop.b
} { .mib	ldfp8		 = [up], 16
	   (p7)	add
		nop.b
		;;
  { .mfi	getf.sig
		xma.l
	   (p6)	cmp.leu		p6, p7 = 
} { .mfi	stf8
		xma.hu
	   (p7)	cmp.ltu		p6, p7 = 
		;;
} { .mib	getf.sig
	   (p6)	add 1
		nop.b
} { .mib	ldfp8		 = [rp], 16
	   (p7)	add
		br.cloop
		;;
} 

2 limbs/20 instructions
	   20 insn/max 6 insn/cycle:		3.3 cycles/2limb
	   8 memops/max 2 memops/cycle:		4.0 cycles/2limb
	   8 intops/max 2 intops/cycle:		4.0 cycles/2limb
	   4 fpops/max 2 fpops/cycle:		2.0 cycles/2limb

================================================================
mpn_submul_1:

The current code just calls mpn_mul_1 and mpn_sub_n and thus needs
about 7 cycles/limb.

We could implement this much like mpn_addmul_1, if we first complement
v.  When v is complemented, the low product limb becomes complement of
true product.  This should allow us to use the accumulation of xma.
Here is how it works:


  #define umul_ppmma(ph, pl, m0, m1, a) \
    do {								\
      UDItype __m0 = (m0), __m1 = (m1), __a = (a);			\
      __asm__ ("xma.hu %0 = %1, %2, %3"					\
	       : "=f" (ph)						\
	       : "f" (m0), "f" (m1), "f" (__a));			\
      (pl) = __m0 * __m1 + __a;						\
    } while (0)

  mp_limb_t
  mpn_submul_1 (mp_ptr rp, mp_srcptr up, mp_size_t n, mp_limb_t vl)
  {
    mp_limb_t cl, cy;
    mp_size_t i;
    mp_limb_t phi, plo;
    mp_limb_t x;
    mp_limb_t ul, vln;

    vln = -vl;

    cl = 0;
    for (i = n; i != 0; i--)
      {
	ul = *up++;		/* will need this in both fregs and gregs */
	x = *rp;
	umul_ppmma (phi, plo, ul, vln, x);

	cy = plo < cl;
	plo -= cl;

	cl = ul - phi;
	cl += cy;

	*rp++ = plo;
      }

    return cl;
  }

================================================================
mpn_mul_1:

The current code runs at 3.7 cycles/limb.  The code is very similar to
the mpn_addmul_1 code.  See comments above.

Faster code wouldn't be too hard to write.  This is one possible
pattern:

  { .mfi	getf.sig
		xma.l
	   (p6) cmp.leu		p6, p7 = 
} { .mfi	stf8
		xma.hu
	   (p7) cmp.ltu		p6, p7 = 
		;;
} { .mib	getf.sig
	   (p6) add 1
		nop.b
} { .mib	ldf8		 = [up], 8
	   (p7) add
		br.cloop
		;;
}

1 limb/12 instructions
	   12 insn/max 6 insn/cycle:		2.0 cycles/limb
	   4 memops/max 2 memops/cycle:		2.0 cycles/limb
	   4 intops/max 2 intops/cycle:		2.0 cycles/limb
	   2 fpops/max 2 fpops/cycle:		1.0 cycles/limb

================================================================
mpn_mul_8

The add+add+cmp+cmp we use on the other codes is optimal for
shortening recurrencies (2 cycles) but the sequence takes up 4
execution slots.  When recurrency depth is not critical, a more
standard 3-cycle add+cmp+add is better.

	ldfp8		v0, v1 = [r35], 16;;

================================================================
mpn_lshift, mpn_rshift

The current code runs at 2 cycles/limb, but has a too deep software
pipeline.  The code suffers badly from the 4 cycle latency of the
variable shift instructions.

Using 63 separate loops, we could use the double-word SHRP
instruction.  That instruction has a plain single-cycle latency.  We
need 63 loops since this instruction only accept immediate count.
